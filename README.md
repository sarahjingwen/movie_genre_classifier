# movie_genre_classifier

Details: This classifier takes in a movie synopsis and predicts out the genre tags. For example, the synopsis of "Uncharted": Street-smart Nathan Drake is recruited by seasoned treasure 
hunter Victor "Sully" Sullivan to recover a fortune amassed by Ferdinand Magellan, and lost 500 years ago by the House of Moncada, would be classified with tgas like Action and 
Adventure. 

Data: To get the data, I tried webscraping the movie titles, synopsis and genres from IMDB.
